# matplotlib-challenge
## Overview
This project involves analyzing data from a fictional pharmaceutical company’s study on the effects of various drug regimens on tumor growth in mice. The goal is to visualize the data using Matplotlib and draw meaningful conclusions from the analysis.

## Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preparation.
- Generate summary statistics for the dataset.
- Create visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, box plots, scatter plots, and line plots.
- Analyze and interpret the results to identify trends and insights.

## Files
- `pymaceuticals.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and visualizations.
- `Mouse_metadata.csv`: Metadata about the mice used in the study.
- `Study_results.csv`: Results of the drug regimen study.

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results
- Key findings include the identification of the most effective drug regimens and insights into tumor growth trends.
- Visualizations provide a clear understanding of the data and support the conclusions drawn.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `pymaceuticals.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
